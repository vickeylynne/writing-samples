# Writing Samples

## Class website and teaching materials

I created the content for this website when I taught XML and DITA for Technical Communicators at Austin Community College. 

In lieu of a textbook for the XML basics portion of the course, I wrote all original content to create an XML Primer. 

This sample illustrates writing content in markdown, using a 'code-as-doc' framework (mkdocs), and the use of Github actions to publish the Gitpages.
